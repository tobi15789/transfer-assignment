## The Forge of Branches

Long before programmers walked the earth, the world’s source code was kept in the Library of One File. The librarians were strict and their rule was simple: only one scribe could write at a time. If two scribes touched the same scroll, thunder shook the shelves and whole paragraphs vanished into smoke.

One winter, the kingdom’s greatest app broke beyond repair. Heroes tried to fix it, but each patch shattered another part. In despair, they climbed the mountain of Broken Builds and called for aid.

From the storm came Linus, the Blacksmith of Revisions, carrying a hammer engraved with seven letters: C-O-M-M-I-T. He struck the anvil and sparks became tiny save points, each one preserving a moment in time.

“No change shall be lost,” he declared. “Every idea deserves a path.”

He split the river of code into many streams and named them branches. Developers traveled each stream, experimenting without fear. When their work was ready, Linus taught the ritual of merge: two histories braided into one, conflict tamed by careful hands.
